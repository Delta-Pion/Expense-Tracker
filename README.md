## ü§ñ AI-Powered Financial Assistant

The standout feature of this Expense Tracker is its intelligent financial assistant. This is not just a simple chatbot; it's a sophisticated AI that understands and responds to your queries about your financial data.

### How it Works

1.  **Natural Language Query:** You ask a question in plain English.
2.  **RAG for Context:** The **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system retrieves relevant transaction data and schema information from the database. This provides the AI with the precise context it needs to understand your finances.
3.  **MCP Server Tool Calling:** The **Multi-Content Prompt (MCP)** framework enables the AI to make specific API calls to the backend to fetch the exact data required to answer your query.
4.  **Informed Response:** The AI combines the retrieved data with its language understanding to provide you with an accurate and insightful answer.

This advanced architecture ensures that the AI can handle a wide range of queries without hallucinations, providing you with a powerful tool for financial analysis.
